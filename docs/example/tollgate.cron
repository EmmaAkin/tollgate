# You should instead change the 'cd /opt/tollgate' path to point to where you
# have deployed tollgate from (normally your own project).  This script needs
# to do some database activities so will need to point to your project as 
# opposed to your installation path for tollgate (unless you're running it in
# the development mode where it is inside tollgate's project).
