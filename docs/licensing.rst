Please be specifically aware of Section 13 "Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License."  This requires you to make modifications to this software available to network users.  The easiest way you can do this is by making a publicly available Git repository for your users.  (GitHub has a nice 'fork' option, which makes it easy for me to track this stuff...)

A notice will appear on all pages unless you set the SOURCE_URL setting to a location where the source code is stored.  This is enforced as some members of the LAN community in my experience are "lax" about following licensing obligations.  Removing the code that enforces this *does not* exempt you from the agreement - it is only there as a reminder and to assist you in license compliance.

Pushing your changes upstream is a great thing to do -- it not only assists other users of the software, but also assists you as internally-developed features don't have to be patched in every time there is a new release.
