# Example configuration for tollgate on apache2 on Debian.
#
# This would normally go in /etc/apache2/sites-available/, then you issue:
# a2enmod tollgate-vhost.
#
# You'll also need to enable these modules: ssl, wsgi, python, rewrite, alias

# Other distributions of apache2 may work with this configuration in some way.


### Main site ###
# This redirects HTTP connections to the HTTPS server, and serves out WPAD
# configuration files.  You should serve out WPAD configuration files as Windows
# machines will request them by resolving from NetBIOS if none is provided.

<VirtualHost *:80>
	# CHANGE ME: This should be set to a proper host name.
	RedirectMatch 301 ^/$ https://portal.example.tollgate.org.au$1
	
	# We should serve up a wpad server as well, because this helps.
	DocumentRoot /opt/tollgate/www/wpad/	
	<Location /wpad.da*>

### NINTENDO WIFI CONNECTION (WFC) ###
# Nintendo (DS, Wii, etc.) gaming consoles do a connection test to validate
# that it has properly connected to the network.  If a captive portal is
# present, this test will fail, and so you can't login on the device if there
# is a browser available.

### Captive Portal Landing ###
# Old versions of tollgate use this.  Now we have TPROXY target support, so we
# don't use this anymore.
