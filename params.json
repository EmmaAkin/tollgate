{"name":"tollgate","body":"# Introduction #\r\n\r\n`tollgate` is a Python/Django-based captive portal system for Linux.  It is primarily for [LAN parties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_party), but can run in other (primarily non-commercial) environments as well.  It's licensed under the terms of the Affero GNU General Public License, version 3.\r\n\r\n`tollgate` has been under development since late 2008, and private releases were deployed since the start of 2009.  It's run everything from 200-person events down to managing the internet connection for five people in a granny flat.\r\n\r\nThe project was open sourced in 2011.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we're prepping tollgate for it's first public stable release, which will become `3.0.0`.  The `master` branch is a bit volatile at the moment, however the software itself is reasonably stable.\r\n\r\nYou may want to check out the git repository to get started.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"A Python/Django-based captive portal system for Linux.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
