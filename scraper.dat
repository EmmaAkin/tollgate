[oui]
; This file contains a list of rules for the scraper
;
; Basically, you put in a regular expression here, and it'll match everything
; that matches it to a particular company name.
;
; All matches are done case-insensitive.
;
; Stuff that isn't matched here WILL NOT be entered into the database.
;
; It's designed to "normalise" all the different names in the file.
;
; You shouldn't need to normally modify this file, unless you're planning on
; changing the way that ouiscraper behaves, or trying to add more entries to
; the database.
;
; This file gets automatically cached into outscraper.dat.cache on the first
; run of ouiscraper.py.  This means that you don't have to wait during
; subsequent runs of the program (these rules are intended to be numerous and
; complex, so any speed boost we can give is a Good Thing).

; Be careful of "Applera Holding" here...
